          <h4>SmartCity</h4>
          <p>We are team SmartCity. With backgrounds in urban geography, systems engineering, computer science, and mathematics, our mission is to use design and technology to tackle urban problems in innovative ways.</p>

          <h4>New Earth</h4>
          <p>When we heard about IGO's discovery of New Earth, we were excited about the opportunity to develop smart infrastructures in a new context. Rather than using design and technology to fix urban problems, we could develop infrastructures that avoided these problems in the first place. The Settlement Project would allow us to start from scratch and be free from regular constraints, particularly in relation to budgets and data availability and access.</p>
          <h4>Challenge: Infrastructures</h4>
          <p>With 80,000 settlers coming to New Earth, there will need to be an infrastructure that allows people and robots to get around easily and go about their daily activities without collisions and congestions. SmartCity proposes to optimize transport by constructing an efficient road network, installing CCTV cameras at intersections, and implementing data processing centers to study the traffic patterns from the images.</p>
          <h4>Our Initiative</h4>
          <p>We have developed a prototype for a web application called "Smart Traffic". Smart Traffic will allow users to input a region and receive live traffic information about major roads and highways in the region. For each major road, a machine learning algorithm is applied to a live image of the road, and returns the image and the level of congestion (low, medium, or high). Having such an application can allow users to check traffic patterns before they leave or on the go, to decide what routes are best to take.</p>
          <h4>Users</h4>
          <p>Traffic is a big problem on Earth and can affect any urban inhabitant who wants to go from A to B. On New Earth, Smart Traffic can guide people to take better routes, which will reduce inconveniences, stress, and road rage. To ensure the safety of its citizens, New Earth will certainly have emergency vehicles such as police cars, fire trucks, and ambulances. The drivers of these emergency vehicles can use our web application to find quicker routes to rescue sites. Smart Traffic can also improve delivery routes. Not to mention, the fewer congestions will lead to less pollution. Though we do not know yet what kind of New Earth vehicles and transport systems will be prominent (e.g. self driving cars, flying cars, electric cars), we can guarantee that these vehicles could benefit from the data science provided by Smart Traffic.</p>
